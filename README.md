# dinosaur-database
 An (incomplete) database of dinosaur clades, genera, species. You can filter by time, weight, length, location, etc.

 Run the database as an html file in the browser with the ```index.html``` file, or if you have <a href="https://elm-lang.org">elm</a>, edit the and recompile the code with ```elm make src/Main.elm --optimize```. If you just want to tinker around try ```elm reactor```, which will rebuild the app as you make changes.
